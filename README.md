## 📖 Project Overview

### 🎯 Objective:
The goal of this project was to build a simple, functional task management app where users can manage daily responsibilities effectively.

### 🔧 What I Used:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery)
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Version Control**: Git

### 💡 Why LAMP Stack?
The LAMP stack is reliable, beginner-friendly, and commonly used in real-world applications. Working with PHP and MySQL gave me valuable backend development experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### **Frontend**  
- HTML: Layout and structure  
- CSS: Responsive design and styling  
- JavaScript (jQuery): User interactions

### **Backend**  
- PHP: CRUD operations

## 💻 Installation & Setup

### 🧱 Prerequisites
- Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP stack)
- Git

### ⚙️ Setup Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/av-coder-hub/task-tracker.git

# 2. Navigate to the project folder

## 🧪 How It Works

The frontend sends HTTP requests (via jQuery) to PHP files that perform CRUD operations on a MySQL database.
