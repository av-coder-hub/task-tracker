## ðŸ“– Project Overview

### **Project Objective**:
The main objective of this project was to create a task management application where users can manage their tasks, keep track of deadlines, and organize their workflow in a simple yet powerful way. Built using **LAMP stack**, this project showcases my skills in:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP for CRUD operations
- **Database**: MySQL for storing task data
- **Version Control**: Git for code management

### **Why LAMP Stack**:
I chose to build this project with the **LAMP stack** because it is a reliable and widely used combination for creating dynamic, database-driven web applications. By using **PHP** for backend logic and **MySQL** for data storage, I gained a deeper understanding of full-stack development.
