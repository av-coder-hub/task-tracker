![Task Tracker Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400?text=Task+Tracker+Portfolio)  
A simple, responsive **Task Tracker Web Application** built with the **LAMP stack** (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). This application allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently, with features such as task creation, editing, completion, deletion, and notifications.

## üöÄ Features
- **Add Tasks**: Easily create tasks with title, deadline, and priority level.
- **Edit Tasks**: Update task details to keep your to-do list up to date.
- **Complete Tasks**: Mark tasks as complete and they move to the completed section.

## üìñ Project Overview

### **Project Objective**:
The main objective of this project was to create a task management application where users can manage their tasks, keep track of deadlines, and organize their workflow in a simple yet powerful way. Built using **LAMP stack**, this project showcases my skills in:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP for CRUD operations
- **Database**: MySQL for storing task data
- **Version Control**: Git for code management

### **Why LAMP Stack**:
I chose to build this project with the **LAMP stack** because it is a reliable and widely used combination for creating dynamic, database-driven web applications. By using **PHP** for backend logic and **MySQL** for data storage, I gained a deeper understanding of full-stack development.

## üíª Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites:
- **LAMP Stack**: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
- **Git**: For version control
- **Text Editor/IDE**: Any of your choice for editing

### Steps to Get Started:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/av-coder-hub/task-tracker.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd task-tracker
3. Set up the LAMP Stack:
   Install Apache, MySQL, and PHP on your local machine.
4. Import the task_tracker.sql file into your MySQL database to set up the tables.
5. Open the index.html file in your browser or configure it to run via your Apache server:
http://localhost/task-tracker


**##üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used**
This project helped me sharpen my skills with the following technologies:

**Frontend**:
HTML: Structure and layout of the application.

CSS: Styling and responsive design.

JavaScript (jQuery): Making the app dynamic and interactive.

**Backend**:
PHP: Handle user requests (CRUD operations for tasks).

MySQL: Database for storing task data.

Version Control:
Git: Used for version control and collaboration.

Icons and UI:
Font Awesome: Icons used for task statuses and other actions.

##üåç **Live Demo**
The live demo for this project will be available soon. Stay tuned for updates.

##üìú **License**
This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md file for details.

##**üèóÔ∏è How It Works**
The app uses PHP for backend logic to perform CRUD operations on tasks, interacting with a MySQL database to persist data. The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to offer a clean and dynamic user interface. The interaction between the frontend and backend happens via HTTP requests, which are handled by PHP files (add_task.php, update_task.php, delete_task.php, get_tasks.php).

**üë®‚Äçüíª Skills & Learning Outcomes**
Frontend Development: I learned how to build a visually appealing UI with interactive features.

Backend Development: I gained hands-on experience with PHP for backend logic and MySQL for data storage.

Version Control: I enhanced my workflow with Git for version control and collaboration.

Task Management: The project helped me understand the importance of managing tasks and deadlines, which is essential in both personal and professional life.

**üèÜ Achievements**
Functionality: The application is fully functional with features like task creation, deletion, updating, and completion.

UI/UX: The user interface is responsive and intuitive.

Learned: Gained proficiency in the LAMP stack and full-stack web development.
